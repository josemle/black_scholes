# Black-Scholes Option Pricing in Rust with Arbitrum Stylus
This repository showcases a Rust implementation of the Black-Scholes Model to calculate the European options price for an asset, specifically utilizing the Arbitrum Stylus SDK. The project is aimed at demonstrating how Rust can be used within a blockchain environment, leveraging Rust's decimal precision through the rust_decimal crate to compute options pricing efficiently.

# What is Black-Scholes?
The Black-Scholes Model is a mathematical model used to calculate the theoretical price of European-style options. It is widely used in financial markets for option pricing, taking into account factors like current stock price, strike price, volatility, time to expiration, and the risk-free interest rate.

For more information on the Black-Scholes model, check out the Wikipedia page.

# Setup and Installation
Prerequisites
Before getting started, you will need:

Rust installed on your machine. If you donâ€™t have it yet, follow the instructions on the official Rust website.
Arbitrum Stylus SDK for deploying and interacting with the Rust smart contract in an Ethereum-compatible environment. Follow the Arbitrum Stylus SDK documentation.
Installation Steps
Clone this repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Arbitrum-Stylus-Black-Scholes.git
cd Arbitrum-Stylus-Black-Scholes
```
Install dependencies: This project uses rust_decimal, an efficient and precise crate for performing financial calculations.
```
cargo build
```
Deploy to Arbitrum: Follow the guidelines in the Arbitrum Stylus documentation to deploy the contract to an Arbitrum testnet or mainnet. Once deployed, you can start calling the compute method.

# Features
 - Rust-based Implementation: Leverages the power and safety of the Rust programming language.
 - Precision with rust_decimal: The rust_decimal crate ensures high-precision arithmetic for financial calculations.
 - Arbitrum Stylus SDK: Demonstrates how to use Arbitrum's Stylus SDK to execute Rust code in an Ethereum-like environment, enabling scalability and performance.
 - Simple, Modular, and Scalable: Designed to be a starting point for more advanced derivatives and options pricing models.
 - Real-time Option Pricing: Computes the price for options based on live market data.

# Usage
The compute method in the contract calculates the price of the option based on the Black-Scholes model. The following parameters are used to compute the result:

 - stock_price: Current price of the underlying asset.
 - strike_price: Strike price of the option.
 - interest_rate: The risk-free interest rate (as a decimal).
 - volatility: Volatility constant for the underlying asset.
 - time_to_expiration: Time to expiration in years (e.g., 0.5 for 6 months).
Once the option price is computed, it returns two values:
 - mantissa: The resulting option price in the form of a large integer.
 - scaling_factor: A scaling factor to convert the mantissa into a usable decimal.

# Example Usage

use rust_decimal::Decimal;
use your_project::black_scholes::BlackScholes;

fn main() {
    let stock_price = Decimal::new(100, 0);  // $100
    let strike_price = Decimal::new(95, 0);  // $95
    let interest_rate = Decimal::new(5, 2);  // 5% risk-free interest rate
    let volatility = Decimal::new(20, 2);    // 20% volatility
    let time_to_expiration = Decimal::new(1, 1);  // 1 year

    let option_price = BlackScholes::compute(
        stock_price,
        strike_price,
        interest_rate,
        volatility,
        time_to_expiration,
    );

    println!("Option Price: {}", option_price);
}
